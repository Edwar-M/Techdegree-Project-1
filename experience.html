          <h3>High School</h3>
          <p>My high school that I attended to is Arise High School which is located near Fruitvale station. In my opinion it's not the best but at the same time it's a welcoming school for anyone. I have plenty of fun memories and many stressful memories. In my freshman and sophmore years I jusr laid back. School wasn't a main priority but at the same time I was still putting in effort in ahcieivng a passing grade. Then on my junior year that's when I took things seriously and put in my full focus.  </p>

          <h3>Internship: Love Cultivating Schoolyards</h3>
          <p>I joined LCS in junior year when I was referred by a freind. LCS which is a part of Oakland leaf is about being at school sites and tending our gardens that we provided for the schools. I learned a vast amount of experience being in that program. We had to take care of young students and I had to be out of my character and to be really disciplined when they are acting up. However, while still being a great role model to them to see how a teenager's life can be. </p>
